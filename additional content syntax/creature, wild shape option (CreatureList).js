/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	To add your own content to the Character Sheet, use the syntax below and save it in a file.
	You can then import this file directly to the sheet using the "Import" button and "Import/Export" bookmark.
	There you can either import the file as a whole or just copy the text into a dialogue.

	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, either by importing consecutive files or pasting the scripts into the dialogue.
	It is recommended to enter the code in a freshly downloaded sheet or to first reset sheet.
	Thus you don't run the risk of things that have already been filled out causing conflicts.

	-HOW TO READ-
	Every line comes with a comment immediately after it to show whether it is // Optional // or // Required //,
	followed by a more explanatory comment

	-THIS IS JAVASCRIPT-
	The imports scripts work by creating a new entry inside an existing object or by calling functions.
	You can create new or overwrite existing global variables by omitting 'var'.
	You will need to understand the basics of JavaScript variables: strings, arrays, and JSON objects.
	Note that every opening symbol must have its closing counterpart: (), {}, [], "", ''.
	If these are not present, the code will give an error when imported.
	Use proper editing software for code (like Notepad++). Text processors like Microsoft Word will screw up your code.
	To help finding syntax errors, use (online) code checking software like https://jshint.com

	-COMMENTS IN THE EXAMPLE-
	Anything on a line after two forward slashes is a comment and will be ignored when running the code.
	Multiline comments are possible. Open them using the forward slash followed by an asterisk and close them with the opposite.
	The below contains a lot of these comments. The comments are not necessary for the script to work, so feel free to remove them.
*/

/*	-INFORMATION-

	Subject:	Creature

	Effect:		This is the syntax for adding a new creature to the sheet,
	        	for use on the companion and wild shape pages.

	Remarks:	You will also need the syntax for adding a weapon if you want the creature
	        	to have attack options.
	        	You will also need the syntax for adding a source if you want the creature
				to have a source that doesn't yet exist in the sheet.
	        	You will also need the syntax for common attributes if you want to use a
	        	custom calculation for hit points (calcChanges.hp).

	Sheet:		v13.1.0 and newer

	Note that this is a variable called 'iFileName'.
	Variables invoked inside an import script will not be available after importing.
	However, if you invoke the variable without the 'var', it will be available after importing.

	This doesn't have to be the same as the actual name of the file.
	This doesn't need to have the .js file extension.

	The variable you input can be a the full semantic version of the sheet as a string (e.g. "13.0.6" or "13.1.0-beta1+201209").
	Alternatively, you can input a number, which the sheet will translate to a semantic version.
	For example:
		FUNCTION CALL						REQUIRED MINIMUM VERSION
		`RequiredSheetVersion(13);`			13.0.0
		`RequiredSheetVersion(13.1);`		13.1.0

	You can find the full semantic version of the sheet at the bottom of every page,

		minlevel    determines at which level the feature is added 
		addMod      add custom modifiers to calculated values
		eval        run a function when added (useful combined with minlevel)
		removeeval  run a function when removed (useful combined with minlevel)
	For a more detailed explanation of these attributes, see below in the
	Companion Page Only section.

	Each name is preceded by a bullet point and, by default, followed by a colon and the description when
	added to the right section, for example:
		{
			name : "Invisibility",
			description : "As an action, the purple crawler magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell)."
		}
	Will result in:
		◆ Invisibility: As an action, the purple crawler magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
	
	If you want something else than a colon, you can change it to anything you like by adding the
	`joinString` attribute. For example:
		{
			name : "False Appearance",
			description : "While the purple crawler remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary purple flower.",
			joinString : "\n   "
		}
	Will result in:
		◆ False Appearance
		   While the purple crawler remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary purple flower.

	If the `description` attribute is not present, no string will be added to the field.
	Any description will do, even an empty string (e.g. description : "").

	The three different attributes, traits, features, and actions, are added to different parts of the companion page:

	ATTRIBUTE		ADDED TO SECTION
	 features		 Features
	 actions 		 Traits
	 traits  		 Traits

	Be aware that languages, resistances, vulnerabilities, and immunities are also added to the
	Features section on the companion page and before the features attribute described here.

	The actions are added before traits to the Traits section.

	The array is processed in the order it is in the code, no sorting will take place.

	These text are also displayed on the wild shape page, but all together in the singular Traits & Features section,
	regardless of their `minlevel` attribute value.
	Also, `eval` and `changeeval` are not executed when this creature is selected on the Wild Shape page.
	As the wild shape pages offer limited space, it is recommended to test if all of
	these and the other attributes together will fit.
	If they don't fit (well), consider using the `wildshapeString` attribute, see below.

/*	minlevelLinked // OPTIONAL //
	TYPE:	array with ClassList object names (variable length) or function
	USE:	dynamically select which level to use for level-dependent features

	This attribute is used to determine at which level objects in the `features`, `traits`,
	or `actions` arrays are added/removed,
	and it is used to determine what level is passed to the `eval`, `removeeval`, and `changeeval` functions.

	This attribute can be one of two things:
	1. an array with ClassList object names
		The level to use will be the class level of the class(es) entered here.
		If you enter multiple ClassList object names, the highest class level will be used.
		The ClassList object names are always written in all lower case (e.g. "wizard").
		If none of the classes are currently selected by the main character, the sheet will default
		to the total class level, or 1 if the level field is empty.
	2. function that returns the number
		The function is called upon any time a level needs to be determined for the creature,
		be it to determine which level to pass to `changeeval` (see below),
		or to determine which `features`, `traits`, or `actions` to add.remove (see `minlevel` above).
		It is passed one variable: a string: the prefix of the Companion page this creature was selected on.
		If it returns false, 0, "", or anything that is not a number, the sheet will default
		to the total class level, or 1 if the level field is empty.

	"Main character" refers to the character on the first page.

		e.g. lvl = [0,5] when the creature gets added and the character is 5th level
		The first entry, the old level, is the level that was passed as the second entry the last time
		this function was called.
		The first entry will be zero (0) if the creature is added for the first time.
		The second entry, the new level, is the current main character level.
