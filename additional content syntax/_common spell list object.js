/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	To add your own content to the Character Sheet, use the syntax below and save it in a file.
	You can then import this file directly to the sheet using the "Import" button and "Import/Export" bookmark.
	There you can either import the file as a whole or just copy the text into a dialog.

	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, either by importing consecutive files or pasting the scripts into the dialog.
	It is recommended to enter the code in a freshly downloaded sheet or to first reset sheet.
	Thus you don't run the risk of things that have already been filled out causing conflicts.

	-HOW TO READ-
	Every line comes with a comment immediately after it to show whether it is // Optional // or // Required //,
	followed by a more explanatory comment

	-THIS IS JAVASCRIPT-
	The imports scripts work by creating a new entry inside an existing object or by calling functions.
	You can create new or overwrite existing global variables by omitting 'var'.
	You will need to understand the basics of JavaScript variables: strings, arrays, and JSON objects.
	Note that every opening symbol must have its closing counterpart: (), {}, [], "", ''.
	If these are not present, the code will give an error when imported.
	Use proper editing software for code (like Notepad++). Text processors like Microsoft Word will screw up your code.
	To help finding syntax errors, use (online) code checking software like https://jshint.com

	-COMMENTS IN THE EXAMPLE-
	Anything on a line after two forward slashes is a comment and will be ignored when running the code.
	Multiline comments are possible. Open them using the forward slash followed by an asterisk and close them with the opposite.
	The below contains a lot of these comments. The comments are not necessary for the script to work, so feel free to remove them.

/*	-INFORMATION-

	Subject:	Common spell list object

	Effect:		This is the syntax for the common spell list object that is shared by multiple things.
				The object determines which spells to use in the drop-downs of the spell selection dialog.

	Important:	The syntax here does not stand on its own.
				You will need another syntax file to use alongside this file.
				Use one of the syntax files not starting with an underscore and use this file when referred to.

	Works with:	Class features (and subclass features)
				Race main attributes
				Racial features
				Background main attributes
				Feat main attributes
				Magic Item main attributes

	Sheet:		v13.0.0 and newer
*/

/*	-IMPORTANT NOTES-
	The object is run through a function that will determine what spells are present
	in the drop-downs in the spell selection dialog.
	For the below explanation the list created by the function is referred to as 'final list'.

	There is no common name for the object, but this example uses 'spellcastingList'.
	This object is always an attribute to another object or passed as a variable in a function,
	meaning that its name is not important and will differ depending on where it is used.

	All entries in the object are optional.
	Each entry except 'extraspells' is used to constrain which spells are added to the final list.
	The entries are cumulative, all constraints must be met for a spell to be added to the final list.
	If no entries are present, the final list will contain all possible spells.
